    <h2 class=tc>How it Works.</h2>
    <h5 class=tc>Linked States:</h5>
    <h5 class=tc>Entangled particles behave as a single system. They lose their individual identities and their properties become correlated. </h5>
    <h5 class = tc>Instantaneous correlation:</h5>
    <h5 class = tc>This correlation holds true no matter how far apart the particles are. If you measure a property of one particle, the state of the other is instantly determined. </h5>
    <h5 class = tc>Theories of Entanglement</h5>
    <h5 class=tc>According to PubMed, "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which entangled systems exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics.</h5>
    <h5 class=tc> It has recently been suggested that a similar process occurs between people and explains anomalous phenomena such as healing."</h5>
    <h5 class=tc>The Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans had a theory on Quantum Entanglement before its discovery. They believed everyone was entangled by the Yuè Lǎo (The Red String of Fate).</h5>
    <h5 class=tc>Their ideas on where the entanglement was differed between ankles, fingers, and such. The idea they have was that everyone was entangled with eachother, causing soul mates.</h5>
    <h5 class=tc>This accurately depicts the theory of Quantum Entanglement, though the truth on the Yuè Lǎo is purely hypothetical, though it may make more sense then it might seem.</h5>
    <h5 class=tc>Quantum Entanglement can be seen as the idea of luck. Anomalous phenomena of miracles can be explained through connection to a healthy molecule, which is purely random and based</h5>
    <h5 class=tc>off of luck. Therefore, it can be assumed that Quantum Entanglement may also prove the idea of luck and soulmates as a mathematical possibility rather than a ficticious story book tale.</h5>
