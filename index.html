    <h2 class=tc>How it Works.</h2>
    <h4 class=tc>Linked States:</h4>
    <h4 class=tc>Entangled particles behave as a single system. They lose their individual identities and their properties become correlated. </h4>
    <h4 class = tc>Instantaneous correlation:</h4>
    <h4 class = tc>This correlation holds true no matter how far apart the particles are. If you measure a property of one particle, the state of the other is instantly determined. </h4>
    <h4 class = tc>Theories of Entanglement</h4>
    <h4 class=tc>According to PubMed, "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which entangled systems exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics.</h4>
    <h4 class=tc> It has recently been suggested that a similar process occurs between people and explains anomalous phenomena such as healing."</h4>
