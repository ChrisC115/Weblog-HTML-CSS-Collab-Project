    <h3 class=tc>Understanding Superposition</h3>
    <h4 class=tc>
      Superposition is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics. It says that a system can exist in multiple possible states at the same time, even though life barely lets any of us exist in one state without falling apart.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
      Instead of choosing a single condition, a quantum system occupies all allowed configurations at once. Only when a measurement is made does the system collapse into one definite outcome, because apparently the universe loves drama.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
      This means a particle can be here and there simultaneously, moving and not moving, existing in overlapping realities. It's weird, but not as weird as humans, so whatever.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
      The collapse of superposition happens when the system is observed or interacts strongly with its environment, forcing it into a single state. Until then, everything just floats in a cloud of possibility. Kind of like all of us trying to figure out who we even are.

    <h4 class=tc>Core ideas of superposition:</h4>
    <ul class=tc>
      <li>A system exists in multiple states at once.</li>
      <li>These states combine into a single quantum description.</li>
      <li>Observation forces the system into one definite state.</li>
      <li>Superposition explains phenomena like interference and entanglement.</li>
    </ul>
