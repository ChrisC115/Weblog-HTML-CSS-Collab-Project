    <h3 class=tc>Understanding the Uncertainty Principle</h3>
    <h4 class=tc>
      The uncertainty principle is a core idea in quantum mechanics. It says that certain pairs of physical properties cannot both be known with perfect accuracy at the same time. Kind of like how none of us ever fully know what we're doing or where we're going.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
      The most famous pair is position and momentum. The more precisely you know where a particle is, the less precisely you can know how fast it's moving. If you try to measure one perfectly, the other slips away. Honestly, it's relatable.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
      This isn’t because of bad tools or clumsy scientists. It's built into the structure of reality itself. On the smallest scales, nature refuses to give us clean, definitive answers. Everything trembles with possibility.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
      The uncertainty principle reminds us that measurement affects the system being measured. Observing something always disturbs it, shifting the outcome. Nothing stays untouched, not even in physics.
