    <h3 class=tc>Schrödinger's Cat Thought Experiment</h3>
    <h4 class=tc>
    Schrödinger's cat is a famous thought experiment, not a real one, designed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 to highlight the perceived absurdity of applying quantum mechanics principles, specifically superposition, to macroscopic objects.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
    In the scenario, a hypothetical cat is placed in a sealed box with a device containing a tiny amount of radioactive substance, a Geiger counter, and a vial of poison. The setup is such that if a single atom decays (a random quantum event), the Geiger counter triggers a mechanism that shatters the poison vial, killing the cat.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
    According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, until an observer opens the box and looks inside, the radioactive atom is in a superposition of both decayed and undecayed states simultaneously. Because the cat's fate is linked to this quantum event, the interpretation implies the cat is also in a superposition, meaning it is both <strong>alive and dead</strong> at the same time.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
    The paradox emphasizes the question of when a quantum system "collapses" into a single, definite reality (either a living or a dead cat), as our everyday intuition tells us the cat must be one or the other, even when unobserved.
