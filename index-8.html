    <h3 class=tc>Understanding Wave-Particle Duality</h3>
    <h4 class=tc>
      Wave-particle duality is the idea that quantum objects act like waves and particles at the same time. Not because the universe enjoys clarity, but because reality is apparently allergic to being straightforward.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
      Light and matter don’t pick one identity. Sometimes they spread out like waves, interfering with themselves. Other times they show up as discrete particles, little packets of energy or matter. It depends on how you look at them, which feels way too similar to people.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
      Experiments like the double-slit test reveal this contradiction clearly: if you don’t observe which path a particle takes, it behaves like a wave and produces an interference pattern. Watch it, and suddenly it acts like a particle. Nothing wants to be perceived without changing a little.
    </h4>
    <h4 class=tc>
      Wave-particle duality shows that the universe isn’t built from neat categories. Everything exists in overlapping forms, refusing to fit into the tidy boxes we expect. Maybe that’s the closest thing physics has to emotional honesty.
